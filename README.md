This demo uses the Observation from WWDC23 with MVVM.

It displays a Like button that toggles an observed bool and whose label updates to reflect the new state.

If I were okay with making all of my decodable models @Observable classes, I might've just preferred to use a model-view (MV) approach. 

I don't necessarily believe that one should use MVVM.

SwiftUI is becoming something where it may not make the most sense.
